   ## UserStory

   As a USER i WANT a dynamic website that allows a user to connect to my created web applications and in itself demonstrates the use of multiple technologies

   ## Development

   To develop this project I first created a wire frame of how the website should appear and operate.This can be viewed under the [Wireframing](#wireframing) section.
   
   * step one) Developing the html structure using bootstrap 4.3.1 elements.

   * step two) Developing a css file to style the html file, adding background images 

   * step three) adding links from the home page allowing a user to navigate through the site

   * step four) developing multiple card structure and the javaScript required for a user to navigate through them.

   * step five) adding further imagery and testing all links

   * step six) adjusting the site to be more responsive to multiple displays

   * step seven) added readme file details

   * step eight) considering how this website can be improved moving forward including adding code to make the site move from day to night mode


   ## Usage

   The user should click on [Links](#links) to explore the website and use buttons to either access deployed applications, application repositories, and my contact information.

   ## Screenshots

   yes, this is a placeholder for screenshots to be added

   

   ## Evolution

   * To evolve this project further i can add further web applications that I have developed to it.
   
   * Have it reviewed by a career guidance tutor to ensure it is delivering in a optimized way.
   
   * Extra code to demonstrate my proficiency in multiple technologies could be added to make the site more interesting.
